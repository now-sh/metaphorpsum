# Metaphorpsum

A simple– if perhaps slightly pedantic– node app for generating heady metaphors. See it in action at [metaphorpsum.com](http://metaphorpsum.com).

The sentence templating engine that powers Metaphorpsum has become a node module called [Sentencer](https://github.com/kylestetz/Sentencer). Metaphorpsum itself has been refactored to use streams.
